# GuaranteeGraphAnalysis
This is a code project for KMPG Idea Challenge 2019.

We are going to create a guarantee graph based on the data KMPG provided. To analyze the interrelationship between those clients, we plan to use Label Propagation algorithm and Social Network Analysis. The final purpose of this project is to predict the overdue risk of loan.
